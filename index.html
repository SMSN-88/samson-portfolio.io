								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>Hi, I am Samson & I'm a self taught Web Developer who is passionate about learning how new technologies helps bring amazing projects to life. My journey into tech started this year in 2022, after working in Finance for over 8 years I felt it was time for a change and even though I knew I wanted to work in Tech, I had no idea about Frontend Development until i discovered the freeCodeCamp and bought my first words to life 'Hello World' I was hooked. Along my short journey while studying the fundamental languages HTML, CSS & JavaScript, I have built a few projects along the way (please see below) and am also currently learning the React framework (bootstrap, Jquery, JSX etc). I'm also a die hard Football fan which other than technology I have a strong passion for.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>I'm currently looking for my first role in Web development & open to networking so feel free to contact me via social media or email & lets connect.</p>

							<h2>Projects</h2>
							<p>These are some of the projects I've built during my
								learning, some I built as part of my learning and others 
								I built of my own back to test myself with what I've learnt.
								Every project I've attempted has been challenging but i can say I'm proud
								of myself as I'm forever wanting to test myself.
							If you click on any of the projects, it will take you to my CodePen account 
							where you'll get to see not only the project but also the codes I used while 
						creating each idea. </p>
